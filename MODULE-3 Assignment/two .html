  <h1>All About CSS</h1>
  <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a language that describes the presentation of a web page, including colors, fonts, layout, and animations. CSS helps separate the presentation from the content of a web page, allowing for easier maintenance and consistency.</p>
