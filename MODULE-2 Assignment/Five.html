       <h2>5. Write a short note on the tab index</h2>
       The tabindex attribute in HTML controls how an element interacts with the keyboard tab order. It basically dictates whether an element can be focused on using the Tab key and determines the order in which it's focused. <br>

Here's a quick breakdown:  <br>

Enabling Focus:  By default, some elements like buttons and links are naturallyfocusable using the Tab key. You can use tabindex="0" on other elements (like divs or spans) to make them tabbable. <br>

Focus Order:  The value of tabindex (positive numbers) determines the order in which elements are focused when you press Tab. Lower numbers get focused earlier in the sequence. <br>
 
Excluding Focus: Setting tabindex to a negative value (usually -1) makes the element non-focusable using the Tab key, but it can still be programmatically focused with Javascript. <br>
