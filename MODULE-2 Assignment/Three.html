<h2>3. What is web accessibility? List some of the assistive devices which play a major role in providing accessibility.</h2>
<b>Web accessibility</b> ensures that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. This means that individuals can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web, regardless of their disabilities. <br>

Here are some key assistive devices that play a major role in providing accessibility: <br>

<b>1.<u> Screen Readers:</b></u> These are essential for individuals with visual impairments. They read aloud the text on a web page, helping users navigate and understand the content.<br>
<b>2.<u> Magnification Tools:</u></b> These tools enlarge on-screen content, making it easier for users with low vision to read and interact with web pages.<br>
<b>3.<u> Speech Recognition Software:</u></b> This software allows users to control their computers and input text using their voice, which is particularly useful for individuals who cannot use a keyboard or mouse.<br>
<b>4.<u> Alternative Text (Alt Text) Generators:</u></b> These tools provide text descriptions for images, which screen readers can then read aloud, making visual content accessible to those with visual impairments.<br>
<b>5.<u> Captioning and Transcription Tools:</u></b> These tools provide text versions of audio content, which are crucial for individuals with hearing impairments. <br>
<b>6.<u>Keyboard Navigation Enhancements:</u></b> These enhancements allow users to navigate websites using only their keyboard, which is helpful for those who cannot use a mouse.
