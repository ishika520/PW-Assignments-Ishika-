       <h2>7. What are the benifits of using Semantic tags in our webpage?</h2>

Here are some of the benefits of using semantic tags in your HTML code:  <br>

<b>1. Improved Readability and Maintainability:</b> Semantic tags make your code much easier to understand for yourself and other developers. By using descriptive tags like header and article, the code itself conveys the meaning and purpose of each section. This makes it easier to navigate and maintain the codebase in the long run. <br>

<b>2. Enhanced Accessibility:</b> Semantic tags provide a clear structure for assistive technologies like screen readers. Screen readers can interpret the meaning of the tags and present the information to users in a way that makes sense, improving the overall accessibility of your website. <br>

<b>3. SEO Advantages:</b> Search engines can better understand the content and structure of your web pages when you use semantic tags. This can potentially lead to better search engine ranking as search engines can grasp the importance and context of different sections on your webpage. <br>

<b>4. Separation of Concerns:</b> Semantic tags focus on the meaning of the content, while CSS styles handle the visual presentation. This separation allows for greater flexibility and easier maintenance. You can change the look and feel of your website without modifying the underlying structure defined by the semantic tags. <br>

<b>5. Future-Proofing:</b> Semantic tags are designed to be meaningful and future-proof. As web technologies evolve, new user agents and assistive technologies may emerge that can leverage the semantic structure of your code for richer interactions and content delivery. <br>
