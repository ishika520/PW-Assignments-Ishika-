       <h2>DBMS: Database Management System</h2>
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application used to create, store, retrieve, update, and manage data in a database.

 It acts as an interface between the database and its users, providing tools to interact with the data effectively.

<h2> The Need for DBMS </h2> <br>
<b>Before DBMS, data was often stored in file-based systems, which presented several challenges:</b> <br>

<b>Data Redundancy:</b> The same data could be stored in multiple files, leading to inconsistencies. <br>
<b>Isolation:</b> Data was often stored in separate files, making it difficult to share and integrate information. <br>
<b>Data Inconsistency:</b> Changes made to one file might not be reflected in other files, leading to inconsistencies. <br>
<b>Poor Data Integrity:</b> File systems lacked mechanisms to ensure data accuracy and consistency. <br>
<b>Limited Data Security:</b> Protecting data in file systems was challenging. <br>
<b>Difficulty in Data Access:</b> Retrieving specific information from large volumes of data was time-consuming. <br> <br>

<h3>To overcome these issues, DBMS was developed. It offers several advantages:</h3> <br>

<b>Data Independence:</b> Data is separated from the applications that use it, making it easier to modify the database structure without affecting applications. <br>

<b>Data Abstraction:</b> Users interact with a simplified view of the data, hiding the complex storage details. <br>

<b>Data Integrity:</b> DBMS ensures data consistency and accuracy through techniques like transactions and constraints.<br>

<b>Data Security:</b> DBMS provides mechanisms to control access to data, protecting sensitive information. <br> 
<b>Data Backup and Recovery:</b> DBMS offers tools for creating backups and recovering data in case of failures. <br>

<b>Improved Data Sharing:</b> DBMS facilitates data sharing among multiple users and applications. <br> 

<b>Efficient Data Access:</b> DBMS optimizes data storage and retrieval, allowing faster access to information.
