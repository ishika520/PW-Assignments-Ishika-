Database Management Systems (DBMS) can be classified based on several criteria. Here are the main types of classifications: 

<h2>1. Classification Based on Data Model </h2>
<b>Relational DBMS (RDBMS):</b> This is the most popular type, where data is stored in tables (relations). Examples include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. It uses SQL for querying and maintaining the database. 

<b>Object-oriented DBMS (OODBMS):</b> Data is stored in the form of objects, similar to object-oriented programming. Examples include ObjectDB and db4o. <br>

<b>Hierarchical DBMS:</b> Data is organized in a tree-like structure. Each record has a single parent and can have multiple children. Examples include IBMâ€™s IMS and Windows Registry. <br>

<b>Network DBMS:</b> Similar to hierarchical DBMS but allows more complex relationships with multiple parent and child records. Examples include CA-IDMS and TurboIMAGE. 


<h2>2. Classification Based on Number of Users </h2> 

<b>Single-user DBMS:</b> Supports one user at a time. Typically used on personal computers. <br>
<b>Multi-user DBMS:</b> Supports multiple users concurrently. Examples include most modern RDBMS like MySQL and PostgreSQL.

<h2>3. Classification Based on Database Distribution</h2> 
<b>Centralized DBMS:</b> The database is stored and maintained in a single location. All users access the database from this central location. <br>
<b>Distributed DBMS:</b> The database is distributed across multiple locations. It can be further classified into: <br>
<b>Homogeneous Distributed DBMS:</b> All physical locations use the same DBMS software. <br>
<b>Heterogeneous Distributed DBMS:</b> Different locations may use different DBMS software. <br>

<h2>4. Classification Based on Architecture</h2>
<b>Client-Server DBMS:</b> The database is stored on a server, and clients access it over a network. Examples include SQL Server and Oracle. <br>
<b>Peer-to-Peer DBMS:</b> Each node in the network can act as both a client and a server. This type is less common but can be found in some distributed systems. <br>

<h2>5. Classification Based on Data Type</h2>
<b>Text DBMS:</b> Designed to handle text data efficiently. <br>
<b>Multimedia DBMS:</b> Designed to handle multimedia data such as images, audio, and video. <br>
<b>XML DBMS:</b> Designed to handle XML data. 

<h2>6. Classification Based on Usage</h2>
<b>OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) DBMS:</b> Optimized for transaction-oriented applications. Examples include banking systems and e-commerce platforms. <br>
<b>OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) DBMS:</b> Optimized for analytical queries and data warehousing. Examples include data mining and business intelligence applications.
