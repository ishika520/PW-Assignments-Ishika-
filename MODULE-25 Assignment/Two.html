       <h2>File-Based Storage System</h2>
A file-based storage system is a traditional method of organizing and storing data in individual files on a computer's hard drive or network-attached storage (NAS) device.

 Files are arranged in a hierarchical structure of directories and subdirectories, making it easy to locate and manage data. <br> <br> 

<b>Challenges of File-Based Storage Systems</b> <br> <br>

<b>Data Redundancy:</b> The same data can be stored in multiple files, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. <br> 
<b> Data Isolation:</b>  Data is often stored in separate files, making it difficult to share and integrate information across different applications. <br>
<b> Data Inconsistency:</b>  Changes made to one file may not be reflected in other files containing the same data, leading to inconsistencies. <br>
<b> Poor Data Integrity:</b>  File systems lack built-in mechanisms to ensure data accuracy and consistency, making data corruption more likely. <br>
<b> Limited Scalability:</b>  File-based systems can struggle to handle large volumes of data and complex data relationships. <br> 
<b> Security Concerns:</b>  Protecting data in a file system can be challenging, as access controls and encryption are often implemented at the file level. <br>
<b> Backup and Recovery Difficulties:</b>  Backing up and recovering data from a file system can be complex and time-consuming. <br> <br>
While file-based storage systems offer simplicity and ease of use for small-scale applications, their limitations become apparent as data volumes grow and data complexity increases.
